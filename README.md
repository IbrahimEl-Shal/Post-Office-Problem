### Post-Office-Problem

![](Output Images/Capture.PNG)

We have n villages {V0, V1, V2, V3, â€¦ ,Vn-1} which have two dimensional coordinates denoted by integer xi
and yi. A post office needs to be built in one of these villages. All villages are well connected with almost a
straight-line road.

* Using brute-force approach, design an algorithm to find the post-office location minimizing the average
distance between the villages and the post office.
* Using brute-force approach, design an algorithm to find the post-office location minimizing the
maximum distance from a village to the post office.
* Support your design by tricks to run those algorithms efficiently.
* Analyze your designed algorithms mathematically and empirically.
* Which minimization is more suitable for this application, average or maximum distance and why? And
which is faster to execute?
